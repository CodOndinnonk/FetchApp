Display all the items grouped by "listId"
Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

Mention that we sorn names as the text, so can happen such examples:  Item 276, Item 29 Item 342
There was no requirement to sort that text as numbers contain, so applied basic tetx sort logic.

Also created test for ensure the correct data filter/sort process
